## Project Name
Iterative Factorial
## About
This project implements an iterative algorithm to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer using JavaScript. The approach employs a loop to calculate the factorial efficiently, avoiding the overhead of recursive calls. The code includes test cases to verify the correctness of the factorial function for various inputs, making it an educational tool for learning basic algorithmic concepts and testing in JavaScript.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., Node.js or a browser console) installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Iterative Factorial includes these features:

-Iterative computation of factorial using a for loop for efficiency.

-Test cases to verify factorial calculations for inputs like 0, 3, 4, and 5.

-Console output to display expected and actual results for easy validation.

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/IterativeFactorial.git`

## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (e.g., factorial.js) in a JavaScript environment, such as Node.js or a browser console: 

`node learnFactorial.js`

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

Understand iterative algorithms and their advantages over recursive approaches for factorial computation.

Gain experience with JavaScript functions, loops, and basic testing using assertions.

Improve skills in writing clear console output for debugging and validation.
